# Advent of code

This repository contains the solutions for the [Advent of code of 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## Run locally

Rust is needed in order to execute the code, see Rust [installation instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

The codebase is separated into the different exercises, each exercise contains two different parts.

One can run any exercise with the targeted part using

```bash
cargo run <exercise_name> <part>
```

Where `part` is either `part_1` or `part_2` and exercise name is defined as follows:

- Exercise #1: `callories`,
- Exercise #2: `rock-paper-scissors`,
- Exercise #3: `rucksack`,
- Exercise #4: `assignement`,
- Exercise #5: `elf-crates`,
- Exercise #6: `marker`,
- Exercise #7: `directory`,
- Exercise #8: `tree-house`,
- Exercise #9: `rope-bridge`,
- Exercise #10: `cathod-ray-tube`,
- Exercise #11: `monkey-in-the-middle`,
- Exercise #12: `hill-climbing`,
- Exercise #13: `distress-signal`,
- Exercise #14: `regolith-reservoir`,
- Exercise #15: `beacon-exclusion-zone`,
